# ENSF619TermProject
Repository for ENSF 619 Final Project, Fall 2020<br>
This was a group project intended to simulate a theater system. A user would, through use of a GUI, be able to search for movies, select
a showtime for that movie, select a seat/seats for the showtime, and enter their payment information to buy their ticket(s). Furthermore,
a user could sign up to be a registered user, which had attached benefits.
A registered user would, through use of a similar GUI, be able to do all of the same things as a user, but would have payment information 
stored in an SQL database. The payment information would be pulled at time of purchase.
